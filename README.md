## INTRODUCTION

**Project Name:**	Bespoke Car Dealer

**Project Aim:** This program is aimed at helping Mr. Carlton Smith ease the task of producing estimates for new cars. Carlton would like a bespoke program implemented in-order for him to quote correct data and print correct estimates.

## PROBLEM DEFINITION:

Carlton Smith is a self-employed car dealer who finds producing estimates for new cars difficult and time-consuming. There are often errors in his calculations which have resulted in him quoting wrong estimates for very small profit and sometimes losing customers because his estimates are too high. 

Carlton has approached Apps R Us to get a bespoke program written so that his estimates become a lot quicker and more accurate.

Carlton wants the program to run on his laptop, which has a new processor, 2GB of RAM, 120GB of free disk space and the current version of the MS Windows® operating system. The laptop is usually connected to an inkjet printer he uses to print completed estimates.
 
## MAIN OBJECTIVES

-	To develop a piece of software that has a wonderful user-friendly environment, which will help Mr. Carlton to calculate each job estimate correctly. 

-	To produce an analysed report for each estimate made.

-	To have components that indicate if the buyer wants additional accessories.

-	To have a trade-in allowance default to 0.

-	To include programming components for Calculation. Clear, Exit and Reset.

-	To allow only the authorised user have access to the program.

In this program there are two different data types used. Any data type can be a variable or a constant, whenever the data stored in a variable will not change during the entire process of the program, it is called constant and can be declared as _final_.

**String:**   A data type used when there is no intention in making calculation with the   data stored in it.

**Double:**   A data type used when the data stored can also be decimal.
